## Using the Application

- By default, the main developer UI is exposed at; https://localhost:8080/
- The Swagger API and documentation is available at; https://localhost:8080/api/
- Which is also exposed directly at; http://localhost:5000/api/

# Running the Application on Docker

## Management Script

The `manage` script wraps the Docker process in easy to use commands.

To get full usage information on the script, run:

```
./manage -h
```

### Build all containers

```bash
./manage build
```

### Build specific container

```bash
./manage build api
```

### Start services

```bash
./manage start
```

### Upgrade a local PostgreSQL 16 database

After updating to the PostgreSQL 18 Docker configuration, leave the existing PostgreSQL 16 `db` container
running and run:

```bash
./manage upgrade-db-16-18
```

The script stops the application services, backs up and validates the configured application database, removes
the PostgreSQL 16 container without removing its data volume, starts PostgreSQL 18 with a new volume, restores
the backup, and restarts the application services. Backups are retained under `docker/postgres-backups/` and are
excluded from Git.

Do not use `./manage down` before upgrading because that command removes project volumes.

### Start in debug mode (with hot reload)

```bash
./manage debug
```

## CHES configuration

The API container maps CHES settings from Docker Compose variables into the .NET `Ches` configuration section. CHES remains disabled when `ChesEnabled` by default.

Set the following values through your local `.env` file other secrets.

```text
ChesEnabled=true
ChesBaseUrl=https://ches.api.gov.bc.ca/api/v1/
ChesAuthUrl=https://example.invalid/token
ChesClientId=replace-with-secret-managed-client-id
ChesClientSecret=replace-with-secret-managed-client-secret
ChesSenderName=Unified Scheduling
ChesSenderEmail=replace-with-approved-sender@gov.bc.ca
ChesTokenRefreshSkewSeconds=60
ChesTimeoutSeconds=30
ChesAllowedAttachment0Extension=.pdf
ChesAllowedAttachment0ContentType=application/pdf
ChesMaxAttachmentSizeBytes=20971520
ChesMaxRecipientsPerMessage=500
```

Additional approved attachment types use matching zero-based .NET configuration indexes. For example, add both `Ches__AllowedAttachmentTypes__1__Extension` and `Ches__AllowedAttachmentTypes__1__ContentType` mappings to `docker-compose.yaml`, backed by corresponding Docker Compose interpolation variables. Both values must be supplied as one approved pair.

### Stop services

```bash
./manage stop
```

### Remove containers and volumes

```bash
./manage down
# or
./manage rm
```

# Dev Container

The VS Code devcontainer starts through `.devcontainer/docker-compose.yaml`. Docker Compose creates the
`unified-scheduling-dev` network and a local `db` service automatically, so a fresh developer does not need to
create the Docker network manually before opening the devcontainer. Inside the devcontainer, the database is
reachable at host `db` on port `5432`.
